The Berkeley Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor
================================================

This is the source repository for the RV64G RISC-V superscalar Berkeley Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM), 
written in the [Chisel hardware construction language](http://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu). BOOM 
is a synthesizable core that targets ASIC processes. It can run on an FPGA (50 MHz on a zc706), 
but optimizing it to be an FPGA soft-core is a non-goal.

For documentation on BOOM visit (https://ccelio.github.io/riscv-boom-doc).

The [wiki](https://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-boom/wiki) may also have more information. 

**Important!**

This repository is **NOT A SELF-RUNNING** repository. To instantiate a BOOM core, please use the Rocket chip generator found in the rocket-chip git repository (https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip).


**Requirements**

These instructions assume you have already installed the [riscv-tools](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools) toolchain.

If you have not, follow additional instructions below.


**Directions**

To build a BOOM Verilator emulator and run BOOM through a couple of simple tests:

````
   $ git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip.git
   $ cd rocket-chip
   $ git checkout boom
   $ git submodule update --init
   $ cd emulator; make run CONFIG=BOOMConfig
````

There are many BOOM configurations to choose from (and modify!). If you would
like to run the Rocket processor, you will need to supply the Rocket
configuration and project configuration:

````
   $ cd emulator; make run CONFIG=DefaultConfig CFG_PROJECT=rocketchip
````

In the boom branch, the `CONFIG` variable defaults to `BOOMConfig` and the
`CFG_PROJECT` variable defaults to `boom`.


 
**Installing the RISC-V Toolchain**

The following (modified) instructions will also build the RISC-V toolchain (if
you have not already do so). You will need to set the $RISCV environment
variable (where the toolchain will be installed) and you will need to add
$RISCV/bin to your $PATH.

````
   $ export RISCV=/path/to/install/riscv/toolchain
   $ export PATH="${PATH}:$RISCV/bin"
   $ git clone https://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip.git
   $ cd rocket-chip
   $ git checkout boom
   $ git submodule update --init
   $ cd riscv-tools
   $ git submodule update --init --recursive
   $ ./build.sh
   $ cd ../emulator; make run CONFIG=BOOMConfig
````

For more detailed information on the toolchain, visit 
[the riscv-tools repository](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tools).

**Using the gem5 O3 Pipeline Viewer with BOOM**

The O3 Pipeline Viewer is an out-of-order pipeline viewer included in the
gem5 suite. BOOM is capable of generating traces compatible with the
pipeline viewer, which is useful for understanding what causes
pipeline stalls and flushes.

To generate gem5 compatible traces, first set O3PIPEVIEW_PRINTF in
`boom/src/main/scala/consts.scala` to true:

````
val O3PIPEVIEW_PRINTF = true  // dump trace for O3PipeView from gem5
````

Rebuild and rerun BOOM. You should find the traces (*.out) in 
emulator/output/. To generate the visualization run:

````
   $ boom/util/pipeview-helper.py -f <TRACE_FILE> > cleaned_trace.out
   $ path_to_gem5/util/o3-pipeview.py --color --store_completions -o pipeview.out cleaned_trace.out
````

You can view the visualization by running:
````
   $ less -r pipeview.out
````
For more details (and to download o3-pipeview.py), visit the [gem5 wiki](http://www.m5sim.org/Visualization).

**Disclaimer!**

The RISC-V privileged ISA,  platform, and Debug specs are still in flux. BOOM will do its best to stay up-to-date with it!

BOOM is a work-in-progress and remains in active development.
